# ToDoList
This is my first project, based on  Node.js .

## Overview
The Goal of this project is to make a Web Application,that will let you create, read, update and delete, your daily tasks.

## Install
Just download the Repo,and your are good to go.
**Note**
Hey remember, I have not included node_modules,you need to get it yourself. If you don't know, how to get them,follow the steps under **First-things-to-Do**.
## Requirements
- You require a browser,and a working terminal.
- Node.js should be installed.
    -There are many resources, from which you can learn how to install Node.js
## First-things-to-Do
After downloading the Repo, and having everything of the **Requirements** follow the following steps:
- Get node_modules folder by running the following command
```sh
npm install
```
  You will see that, now there is a folder called node_modules,which contains all the dependancies this project requires.
